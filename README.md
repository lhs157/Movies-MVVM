This is a very basic project using MVVM Architecture pattern with RXSwift for data binding from OMDB
Users can enter the movie title on top to search for movie data from OMDB.

Pod libraries are already included. So you can run the project directly without configurations.

Techniques and libraries used:
- RXSwift for binding data between View & View Model.
- Alamofire for making requests for Decodable objects.
- Kingfisher for displaying and caching images.
